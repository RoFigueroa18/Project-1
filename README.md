Global Energy Data Analysis
Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of global data on energy access, renewable energy usage, and their socioeconomic implications. Using data from the year 2000 to 2020, we will explore how different nations have progressed in terms of energy infrastructure and environmental sustainability, and how these factors correlate with economic indicators such as GDP per capita.
The data analyzed include key metrics like the percentage of the population with access to electricity, the use of clean fuels for cooking, electricity generation from renewable and fossil sources, and CO2 emissions. These indicators are crucial for understanding global energy policies and their impacts on both human development and the environment.

Objectives of the Analysis
Evaluate Electricity Access: Analyze how access to electricity has changed over time and its impact on human and economic development.
Explore Renewable Energy Usage: Determine the evolution of renewable energy usage and its contribution to the global energy supply.
Relationship between Energy and Economy: Study the interactions between energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic growth.
Identify Trends and Correlations: Discover significant patterns and correlations between different energy and economic indicators.
