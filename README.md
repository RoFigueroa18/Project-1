"Sustainable Energy and CO2 Emissions: Analyzing Global Trends and Impacts on Development"
This project focuses on sustainable energy use and its relationship with economic and social development. Here is a summary of the main points covered:

Sustainable Development Goals: The presentation addresses 17 goals with 169 targets covering economic, social, and environmental spheres. These goals are interconnected and indivisible, focusing on holistic development.
Energy Consumption and Climate Change: Energy consumption is identified as the primary cause of climate change, accounting for approximately 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Affordable and Clean Energy: The importance of ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for the development of critical sectors such as agriculture, business, communications, education, health, and transportation is highlighted.
International Comparisons:
CO2 Emissions: CO2 emissions between the BRICS countries and Mexico versus the G7 countries are compared.
Global Energy Sources: The use of nuclear, renewable, and fossil fuels globally is compared.
Energy Evolution:
Electricity from Fossil Fuels and Renewables: The evolution of these energy sources from 2000 to 2020 is examined.
Access to Clean Fuels for Cooking in BRICS Countries: The improvement in access from 2000 to 2020 is shown.
Renewable Electricity Generation Capacity:
The renewable electricity generating capacity per capita in different countries and its relationship with GDP per capita is shown.
The countries with the highest consumption of each energy type and trends in renewable capacity per capita for BRICS countries and Mexico from 2000 to 2020 are highlighted.
Economic Relationships:
The relationship between the use of "Clean Energy" and "GDP" is explored.
The relationship between electricity generated from renewable sources and CO2 emissions in the United States is analyzed.

Overall, the presentation uses data and statistics to underline the urgency and importance of transitioning to more sustainable and clean energy sources as key to combating climate change and promoting equitable development.
