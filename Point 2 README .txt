Point 2 README 

Overview
This project conducts a comparative analysis between BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to understand various socio-economic and environmental metrics. The primary focus areas include access to clean cooking fuels, CO2 emissions, relationships between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions, and the economic indicators such as GDP per capita related to energy output.

Key Findings
Access to Clean Cooking Fuels (2000-2020)

All G7 countries have maintained 100% access to clean cooking fuels since 2000, showcasing their advanced development status.
Among BRICS nations, Brazil and South Africa are close to achieving similar access levels, with Brazil at 95.9% and South Africa at 86.8% in 2020.
India demonstrated substantial progress, improving access from 22.3% in 2000 to 67.9% in 2020. Continued development suggests BRICS could soon achieve complete access.
CO2 Emissions Analysis

The US had the highest CO2 emissions among G7 and BRICS nations in 2000 but saw a significant reduction by 2019, likely due to a shift from manufacturing to a service-based economy.
Conversely, CO2 emissions in China and India have increased markedly, corresponding with their industrial growth.
Forecasting CO2 Emissions (2020-2030)

Using ARIMA models for time series forecasting, projections suggest increasing CO2 emissions for China and India, with China expected to have the steepest rise. The US's emissions are projected to stabilize.
Impact of Renewable Energy on CO2 Emissions

Despite increased renewable energy production, China and India's CO2 emissions continued to rise, indicating current efforts are insufficient to meet international climate goals.
The USA and Japan, however, have shown emission reductions, which correlate with increases in renewable energy outputs, suggesting a successful strategy in these nations.
Economic Growth and Energy Output

The analysis explores the relationship between GDP per capita and various forms of energy output, highlighting China's strong direct correlation between increased energy output (especially from fossil fuels) and GDP growth.
The US displays a less pronounced relationship, but a notable direct negative correlation exists between GDP per capita and fossil fuel output, signaling a shift towards cleaner energy.
Conclusions
The project reveals significant insights into the socio-economic and environmental dynamics of the BRICS and G7 nations. While G7 countries typically showcase higher development indicators, BRICS countries are catching up, especially in access to clean cooking fuels and economic growth driven by increased energy outputs. The disparate impacts of renewable energy investments on CO2 emissions across these countries highlight the complexity of achieving international climate goals. The data-driven approach, particularly the use of ARIMA models for forecasting, provides a robust foundation for predicting future trends and planning appropriate policy responses.
